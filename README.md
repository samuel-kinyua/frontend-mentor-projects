## My process

  ### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom 
- CSS Grid

  ### What I learned

i have learnt how to ensure that the code is centered on the page using html element <centre></centre> on the code block you want to center.
I have also learnt how to ensure that a box only extends within the limit i intend rather than covering the entire page using (width: min-content;)



 ### Continued development

I inted to continue working on creating responsive website and learn the flexbox and grid
